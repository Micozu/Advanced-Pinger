# Network Ping Utility

This Python-based tool allows you to ping a specific IP address and port using both **TCP** and **UDP** protocols, displaying real-time round-trip times for each protocol. It can also automatically detect whether the connection is available using either TCP or UDP and show the results in a color-coded output for easy visualization.

### Features:
- Supports **TCP** and **UDP** protocols.
- **Multi-threaded** to run TCP and UDP pings simultaneously.
- **Real-time** display of round-trip times for each protocol.
- **Color-coded output** to differentiate between successful connections, errors, and time statistics.
- **Automatic protocol detection** (TCP/UDP) based on connectivity.
